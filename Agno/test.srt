What exactly is Generative AI?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
When new content is created by artificial intelligence, it's called Generative AI.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This could involve generating texts and images, as well as videos, music or voices.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
To do this, you describe in a chat dialogue box what you want the AI to create.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This description is called a prompt.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The Generative AI tools provide answers to all sorts of questions,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
summarise complex information and generate diverse ideas quickly.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Depending on how they're used, they can create short stories, paintings, pieces of code or even musical compositions.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The foundation for this creation lies in large amounts of data that the AI system accesses to identify patterns and similarities.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The content produced by the AI is new.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's often impressive and challenging to distinguish from things humans have made.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Generative AI can also be misused.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In so-called deepfakes, AI is utilised to produce images or videos that seem real.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
AI-generated texts are also tough to recognise as machine-made.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Moreover, the AI can provide answers that sound correct but are actually incorrect.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is called hallucinating.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The quality of what's created depends on both the quality of the data used and the quality of the prompts given.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
To effectively utilise Generative AI, we need to learn how to guide the tools with meaningful prompts and use them thoughtfully.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Generative AI holds immense potential and can help us in many ways, such as serving as a writing or learning partner.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
However, the AI should do the hard work and humans should be responsible for the facts.
